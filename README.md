# Immune History

Our objective is to serve the purpose of the people and helping for improving the medical science. For research purposes huge amount of medical data is needed. We are living in third world country. Despite of  this we are doing good in pharmaceutical sectors. But  we are not able to invent new generic medicines for new diseases and rely upon other countries to invent it. The reason behind this is no research and lack of medical data.
Through this app user can appoint a doctor and get treated online and all the treatment history stored on the database which can be helpful for future analysis
